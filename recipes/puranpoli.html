    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My delightful Puran Poli recipe with step-by-step photos will show you how
      to make the traditional Indian treat. This lentil stuffed sweet flatbread
      is a popular Maharashtrian recipe made during Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali,
      Holi or any other festive occasion. While it does take a bit of skill and
      patience to make, the results are well worth it! And as an added bonus,
      this sweet recipe also happens to be pretty darn nutritious, meaning you
      can even eat it for breakfast.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup chana dal</li>
      <li>3 cups water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Ghee</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse the chana dal first very well in water. I didnâ€™t soaked the chana
        dal but you can also soak the chana dal for 30 minutes to one hour and
        then drain the water.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a 3 litre pressure cooker, cook the chana dal with 3 cups water for 6
        to 7 whistles on medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        The dal has to be cooked well. If you soak the chana dal, the cooking
        time will be reduced.
